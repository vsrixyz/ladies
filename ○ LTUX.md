# Goals
Deliver a talk to the [Ladies that UX](https://www.facebook.com/LTUXSF/) crew. Expected audience is 100 folks, mostly junior designers or new to the industry. Looking for something to give them a fun intro to the world of content design.

Adapting my talk from Creative Careers into a new talk called "Designing with words, it's a thing"
